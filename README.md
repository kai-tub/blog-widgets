# Widget collection
Collection of widgets for my [master thesis blog](https://kai-tub.github.io/master-thesis-blog/).
By running [mybinder](https://mybinder.org/) in the background these widgets will be created via [nbinteract](https://www.nbinteract.com/).
To comply with the constraints of *repo2docker*, every widget with very different environment requirements, needs to live on a separate
branch. To make this clear, the *master branch* will always stay empty.

This repository only exists to be able to develop and generate these widgets.
To play around with the widgets, please look at my blog where the generated files are hosted:
